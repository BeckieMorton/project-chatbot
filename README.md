# Project Name

Week 2 - Project Chatbot - The Dom, functions and scope. 

This week's project was about building a functional chatbot interface using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The user can interact, and the bot can ask questions, display messages, and respond with precision.

## The problem

<ins>Describe how you approached to problem</ins>:

I tried to sketch out the program flow using UML diagrams (flowchart) as I was initially confused with the base code give to use and the first function that fires when their is an event.

I had three big problems that I spent many hours trying to solve
 1 - getting input data from the user when they used buttons and the dropdown
 2- tracking the flow of my program now that we are using functions. I need to sketch them out using the flowcharts/diagrams I learned at university 2 decades ago! Let me see if I can remember them
 3 -Event Listeners -  I ended up having to put Event Listeners inside my functions for Question 3 onwards as I could not get them to respond using the event listener provided.

 I was proud of being able to use several input types, text, buttons, select dropdown, and date.

<ins>How did you plan?</ins>: I learned this week that planning with some type of UML design tool is super helpful. There was alot of new concepts and code to learn so taking time with the learning material was also important to plan.

<ins>What technologies did you use?</ins>: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

<ins>If you had more time, what would be next?</ins>: I would include more questions and an email question to store the users email. I would also perfect the error handling.

I found this week very challenging! Week 2 down, 20 to go!
