# Project Name

Week 2 - Build a Chatbot. Complete “Step 1-5” stated in the GitHub repo’s instructions. 
Make a simple chat bot that accepts user input (in a textbox and for a challenge using other inputs), and displays it, with the bot responding appropriately.

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

I tried to sketch out the program flow using UML diagrams (flowchart) as I was initially confused with the base code give to use and the first function that fires when their is an event.

I had three big problems that I spent many hours trying to solve
 1 - getting input data from the user when they used buttons and the dropdown
 2- tracking the flow of my program now that we are using functions. I need to sketch them out using the flowcharts/diagrams I learned at university 2 decades ago! Let me see if I can remember them
 3 -Event Listeners -  I ended up having to put Event Listeners inside my functions for Question 3 onwards as I could not get them to respond using the event listener provided.

 I was proud of being able to use several input types, text, buttons, select dropdown, and date.

 I found this week very challenging!
